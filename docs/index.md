Welcome to the Western Washington region of Christian Bible Quizzing.

Western Washington (WWA) is a [provisional region](*/governance/regions.md) of Christian Bible Quizzing. _(WWA is the successor organization to Pacific Northwest Bible Quizzing, an [incorporated region](*/governance/regions.md) of CBQ.)_ The ministry provides youth and adults with an opportunity to be involved in the systematic study and application of God's Word. Through this and the competition at regular quiz meets, the program builds character, instills self-discipline, and encourages prayer and unity. It equips participants with the capacity to serve in other areas of ministry, and it prepares them well for their future adult lives.

To find the next quiz meet, please consult our [Season Schedule](/meet/schedule).

## What is Bible Quizzing?

Bible Quizzing is a Christian sport in which teams of participants compete on Bible memorization in a context that requires a combination of speed, accuracy, and strategy and a culture that inspires collaboration, fellowship, and mutual encouragement.

At its core, Quizzing is about writing God's Word on hearts. By appealing to the transformational power of Scripture, Quizzing is the catalyst that changes many lives across the world. Quizzing thrives in several countries beginning with its origin in the United States and Canada but has spread to the Dominican Republic, Jordan, and far beyond.

Bible Quizzing is a powerful ministry that claims God's promise that no word of God will return empty.

## Why join Quizzing?

Quizzing offers so much more than just competition and sport. The program involves memorizing a specific book or books of the Bible each quiz year. By becoming involved in memorization, quizzers develop a love and respect for the Bible. The Word is written on their hearts, and consequently it dynamically influences them. Bible Quizzing helps youth develop a genuine concern for others. Quizzers learn to rely on the Lord and not themselves to attain their goals. Quizzing also gives a biblical perspective for everyday life and helps in the application of scriptural principles.

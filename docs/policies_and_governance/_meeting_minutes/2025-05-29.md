- Burdensome hosting requests: The Board voted unanimously to approve a hosting policy statement/policy as written below, which the Regional Coordinator will be send out in the 2025-2026 welcome email from the Regional Coordinator
- Mitigating post-deadline registration changes
    - This was discussed, and the Board voted unanimously to start with a positive incentive for the quizzers for a two-fold purpose:
        - The quizzers may be motivated to hold their coach available to registering on time and they may evangelize in order to gain more teammates through this positive reinforcement
        - The Board would like to see how this works for a couple of meets and then reevaluate strategy as necessary
    - The new policy is written up below
- Mitigating teams voluntarily leaving the meet early: This was discussed, and the Board voted unanimously by the board as a two-fold approach:
    - Any team leaving prior to awards will be ineligible to win the registration raffle with the exception of teams traveling more than 5 hours to get home
    - Recognize team average points as per Gryphon’s suggestion above during the awards ceremony

## Hosting Policy Statement/Policy

Hosting, especially handling housing, can be a lot of work; and Quizzing doesn’t operate without hosts willing to commit to host every season. Therefore, the following are our hosting policies:

- Overnight housing
    - Meet host organizations may elect to offer housing based on whatever criteria they deem possible
    - Housing is offered as a gift to Quizzing by hosts on a “this is the best we can offer” understanding
    - Hosting standards (except as altered explicitly and exclusively by meet host organizations):
        - Housing offered is limited to quizzers and 1 coach per team
        - Though any host home may elect to provide improved accommodations, a clean though hard floor is the default housing provision; therefore, teams are expected to bring sleeping bags, pillows, and options for breakfast
- Meet hosting
    - Meet host organizations will strive to provide as many quiz rooms as they are reasonably logistically capable
    - Quiz rooms need 9 chairs, a QM table and chair, access to electricity, and wifi coverage and access (which can be exclusive to the officials)
    - Meet host organizations do not need to provide QMs with snacks, though such bribes will always be graciously accepted
- Lunch provision
    - Meet host organizations may elect to offer lunch based on whatever criteria they deem reasonable
    - Offering a peanut-free environment with options for common dietary restrictions is the ideal but not required
    - Price per meal is set entirely by the meet host organization
    - Lunch payment to be made via cash or checks written to the meet host organization

## Post-Deadline Registration Changes Policy

- All churches that were registered on time will be announced at the welcome announcements
- For each quizzer from that church, a raffle ticket will be put into a raffle
- As the first thing at the awards ceremony, the raffle will be drawn and the quizzers from that time will receive a button stating: “My Coach Registered on Time”

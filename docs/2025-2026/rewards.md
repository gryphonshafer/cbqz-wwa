# Rewards for Cumulative Memorization and Prompt Registration

To encourage quizzers to always be memorizing more verses (and to encourage coaches to confirm their registration data for meets before registration deadlines), we're supporting the following rewards system:

Coaches are asked to track (in whatever way or ways they deem best, though we encourage consideration of [QuizSage](https://quizsage.org)'s _Memorization_ toolset) the verses memorized per each of their quizzers. Coaches are then asked to input the cumulative verses memorized per quizzer in their registration data when registering for a meet (using the online registration system on this web site). If the registration data is submitted prior to the deadline, the quizzers and teams will be eligible for rewards distributed at the beginning of the meet.

## Quizzer Cumulative Memorization Rewards

We'll recognize and reward quizzers who surpass cumulative verse count thresholds. Upon crossing a threshold, the quizzer will receive a badge indicating the threshold crossed, and each threshold badge (when worn) unlocks rewards for the quizzer.

| Threshold | Rewards (Cumulative)                                                         |
| ---------:| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|        24 | Cumulative memorization badge indicating the threshold achieved              |
|        40 | Front-of-line privileges during lunch (ordered by maximum threshold crossed) |
|        70 | May take treats from any officials’ table (for the quizzer’s own use)        |
|       144 | Assorted bag of individually wrapped candy                                   |
|       245 | T-Shirt (CBQ-branded)                                                        |
|       490 | Hoodie (CBQ-branded)                                                         |

## Team Prompt Registration Rewards

Each team of every team organization whose registration data was submitted prior to the registration deadline and that contained complete quizzer cumulative memorization counts will be entered into a raffle. The winner will receive badges indicating their win and a box of Girl Scout cookies.
